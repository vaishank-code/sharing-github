# The NHS Efficiency Dilemma: Expand or Optimise?
This project analyses NHS appointment data to understand service demand, capacity pressures and operational inefficiencies across primary care settings. It focuses on evaluating whether existing resources are being used effectively and where improvements could be made to support patient outcomes and staff wellbeing.

### Objectives
The analysis was guided by two key questions:
- Is current staffing and capacity sufficient to meet demand?
- How efficiently are existing resources and appointment types being used?

### Key Findings
- Daily utilisation exceeded NHS capacity thresholds on over half of days, showing sustained workload pressure.
- GPs delivered most appointments, while Extended Access and PCN services were underused, suggesting opportunities for redistribution.
- 13 million missed appointments annually represent a major efficiency and financial challenge.
- Appointment modes were predominantly face-to-face (60%) and telephone (35%), with limited digital uptake.
- Seasonal and geographic variation indicated uneven demand and staffing strain across regions.

### Recommendations
- Immediate focus: redistributing workload across service settings, targeted recruitment, and improved patient engagement to reduce no-shows.
- Mid-term: increased digital access, improvements to scheduling flexibility, and learning from lower-demand regions.
- Long-term: better appointment tracking and real-time dashboards for proactive decision-making.
